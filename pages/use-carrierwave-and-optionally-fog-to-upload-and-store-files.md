# How to use CarrierWave (and optionally fog) to upload and store files #

#### Introduction

CarrierWave is used to upload and store files (typically images and documents) for Ruby applications. For example, you might use CarrierWave to associate and store photos with user identities. (CarrierWave is an alternative to Paperclip.)

For a general introduction to CarrierWave, see this [[Railscast 253|http://railscasts.com/episodes/253-carrierwave-file-uploads]].

CarrierWave without fog is good for testing and for small applications: files are stored "locally" in AppCloud. See [Setting up CarrierWave for local storage in AppCloud][2] below. 

However, for larger applications in production, consider using CarrierWave with fog to upload files to a specialized storage service, such as Amazon S3. See [Setting up CarrierWave for online storage with a web service][3] below.

#### Introduction

Use CarrierWave to store files locally on your AppCloud instance if:  

* You want to try out CarrierWave with your application. 
* You have a small number of files. (The files take up space on your instance.)

Do not use CarrierWave locally if you are using a cluster because files uploaded to one instance are inaccessible from another. 

#### To install and use CarrierWave for testing and small applications

(For Rails 3.0.X and CarrierWave 0.5.4)

1. Add the gem file to your Rails project.

        gem 'carrierwave'

2. Generate an uploader to manage the file to upload.   
    For example, uploading avatars for user profiles.

        rails generate uploader Avatar

3. Create a migration to add a column to the model that will use the uploader.  
    For example, adding avatar to our user model.

        add_column :users, :avatar, :string

4. In the model, mount the uploader:

        class User
            ...
            mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
            ...
        end

**Note:** You must set the form to be multipart for file uploads to work:<br> `<%= form_for @user, :html => {:multipart => true} do |f| %>`

#### Introduction

Using CarrierWave with fog gives you flexibility to store your files on any cloud service supported by fog and to switch between them as needed. This also keeps your uploaded files separated from your AppCloud instance â€” making a cleaner application.
	
This example uses Amazon S3, which is a popular online storage web service. However, you can use any fog-supported service to store your files for retrieval with CarrierWave.

#### To setup and use CarrierWave with fog

1. Follow the instructions in the [above][2] to install CarrierWave and implement CarrierWave.

2. Add the fog gem to your Gemfile for Rails 3.

3. After generating an uploader file, edit the file (in the app/uploaders directory) to set storage to fog:

        storage :fog

4. In the config/initializers directory, create fog.rb to store the service provider name and credentials.    
    For example, if the service is Amazon S3, the fog.rb might look like this:   

        CarrierWave.configure do |config|
	      config.fog_credentials = {
	        :provider               => 'AWS',
	        :aws_access_key_id      => 'secret',
	        :aws_secret_access_key  => 'secret',
	      }
	      config.fog_directory  = 'my_uploads'
	      config.fog_public     = false        
	    end
